# Xilinx MIG Example
This project serves as a simple reference design for using the onboard DDR2 memory with Xilinx MIG IP of the Nexys 4 DDR / Nexys A7 FPGA Trainer board.

The included [step-by-step PDF guide](Nexys%204%20Onboard%20DDR2%20MIG%20Configuration.pdf) walks through the configuration process.
